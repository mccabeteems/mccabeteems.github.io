	<h1>Things I Like</h1>
	<p><a href="https://www.oldnyc.org">OldNYC</a> is an online navigator of the NYC Public Library's archive of old photographs arranged in a map format, so you can click on any cross streets and find some old pictures from that location.</p>
	<p> <a href="https://abandonednyc.com/">AbandonedNYC</a> is a cool blog that discusses abandoned buildings in the NYC area with lots of incredible photographs and descriptions.</p>
	<p><a href="https://nyc-noise.com/">NYC Noise</a> is a constantly updating calendar of every experimental/free/noise/avant-garde music show that is happening in the city at any given time. Very useful for trying to find something Happening.</p>
	<p><p> Zack of <a href="https://infinitedigits.co/tinker/">Infinite Digits</a> is a master tinkerer of electronics and sound machines who I aspire to be like someday. </p>
	<p>Here are two photos of Rachel Goswell drinking beer and at some point this was photoshopped to change the brand of beer and I am not sure why this was done or which one is the original. </p>
