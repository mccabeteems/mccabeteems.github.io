	<p>Recently I have been getting into graffiti and spotting all the tags and throws around the city has been a lovely constant game. I found <a href="https://www.bombingscience.com/graffiti-letters-61-graffiti-artists-share-their-styles/">this article</a> that catalogues some really amazing writers' handstyles.</p>

	<p>Here are two photos of Rachel Goswell drinking beer and at some point this was photoshopped to change the brand of beer and I am not sure why this was done or which one is the original. </p>
